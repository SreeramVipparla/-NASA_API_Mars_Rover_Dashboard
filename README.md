# Introduction

In this project I have created a NASA Mars Rover Dashboard that consumes the NASA API and displays information about the rovers on Mars. The dashboard allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. I have used JavaScript, HTML & CSS to create the dashboard.
